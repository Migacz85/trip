# Trip Journal

This project is a webpage witch will store all interesting information from different
countries I have been. Web will focus on travelling, attractions and stories.
Project is easily scalable and can be changed to different topic. You can use it as a
template for your needs.

## UX

This website is for people who are interested in travelling.
This is the reason why it will be categorized by country.

## Testing

When clicking in:
"trip journal" logo page is taking visitor to index.html ,
"Spain" page is taking visitor to index.html (main content of the page),
"+" - navigation  is showing,
"-" - navigation is disappearing,
links in navigation - page is taking to relevant sections on the page,
"play on audio button" - audio is playing,
"play on youtube movie" - movie is playing,
map - is correctly working.


### Bugs

When validating using css validator there are known warnings:

29		-webkit-box-sizing is an unknown vendor extension
73		-webkit-sticky is an unknown vendor extension
233		-webkit-box-shadow is an unknown vendor extension
254		-webkit-box-shadow is an unknown vendor extension

Why they are showing ? Why i leave them ?

1. Those errors will help support browser compatibility efforts.
2. The validator only validates against valid code.
3. And the vendor extensions are proprietary code.
4. As such it will always be invalid.
